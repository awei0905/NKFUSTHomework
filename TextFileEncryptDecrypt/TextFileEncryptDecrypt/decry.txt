This is a secret letter to work with a C program.
This letter in plane.txt file will be encrypted by a formula:
c=((113*(p-32)+45) mod 94) + 32, and then stored in cypher.txt file.
Then the letter in cypher.txt file is decrypted by a formula:
p=((5*(c-32)+ 57) mod 94) + 32, and then stored in decry.txt file.
